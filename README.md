This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code where an observer is not properly removed. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the observed object is deallocated before the observer is removed. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with proper observer removal.  This example highlights the importance of meticulous memory management when using KVO in Objective-C.
